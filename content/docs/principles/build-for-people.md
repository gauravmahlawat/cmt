# Build for People

We don't write code in a vacuum. We write code to solve problems for our customer, using systems used by their customers, all of which will be maintained by your teammates. We write code once but it is read many times and executed significantly more times.

## Solve the problem {#solve}

You could write the most beautiful, most efficient, most poetic code you possibly can, but if it doesn't help your customer, it doesn't help anyone. Write great code and solve the problem.

## Write readable code {#readable-code}

Do not try to be clever with your code. There is a saying that debugging is harder than writing code. So if you write the cleverest possible code then, by definition, you are not clever enough to debug it.

Write your code so that it can be read and understood by other people.
