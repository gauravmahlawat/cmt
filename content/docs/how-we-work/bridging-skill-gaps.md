# Bridging Skill Gaps

No one knows everything. We all have things to [learn]({{< relref "../behaviors/learn" >}}) and we see that when working on a project or implementing a solution. Some of us have gaps in our coding fundamentals, some in their implementation of standard practices, and so-on.

Identifying and filling skill gaps go hand-in-hand. For example, when we are in project we learn and implement project tasks in parallel. Or when we are on bench, we try to learn a technology and implementations and get involved in the community through various activities (say, involved in contribution activities and giving back to Drupal by contributing projects, solving issues, etc.) and prepare ourself for better tomorrow. At other times, we have no choice and we even have to borrow time from our busy lives and improve a particular skill(s).

We understand the importance of time and we never miss an opportunity to improve on skills or learn something new. We believe that "[Asking for help]({{< relref "../behaviors/ask-for-help" >}}), is a strength" and we continue to openly discuss identified gaps with career managers, performance coaches, and even team members and work on the concluded action items. As a team member, whether junior or senior, we do not hesitate to help each other learn something new; including sharing initial guidance and motivation when gaps are identified.

## Learning Management System(LMS)

The course materials available in our [LMS](https://learning.axelerant.com) supports a learning environment to understand the fundamentals around a particular topic.

We keep updating our LMS with new courses/contents and probably all topics may not be available at this point of time. Also, we prefer not re-inventing the wheel and hence in our LMS references to existing learning materials accessible over the internet(Example, Youtube, Drupalizeme etc.) is expected.
