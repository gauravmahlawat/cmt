# Doing the local setup

## Setting up a new site

We prefer [`ddev`](https://ddev.com/) for the local setup due to its compatibility with [`Apple chips`](https://ddev.com/ddev-local/arm64-apple-silicon-m1-ddev-local-what-does-it-all-mean/).

## Setting up an existing site

Most probably the setup will contain either [`lando`](https://lando.dev) or [`ddev`](https://ddev.com). Make sure you have the respective tool installed on your machine. Then, execute the tool's start command.
