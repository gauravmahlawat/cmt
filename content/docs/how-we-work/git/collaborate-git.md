# Collaborating with Git

Contributing to a project using Git involves a collaborative process of creating, testing, and submitting changes, allowing for efficient and effective collaboration. Git's version control features enable contributors to track changes, create new branches, and merge proposed changes, while the distributed nature of Git allows for teammates to share their work, provide feedback, and collaborate in real-time. By utilizing Git's tools and workflows, contributors can work together to improve the quality of code, ensure project stability, and ultimately achieve success in their project’s goals.

After knowing the project we want to contribute to, it is recommended to read the project’s contribution guidelines. Most projects have their own contribution guidelines. These guidelines will inform us on how to contribute to the project.

Major steps on how to contribute to a project with Git:

- Fork the project repository. Forking a project is the process of creating a copy of the project that we can work on locally. This allows us to make changes to the project without affecting the original one.

- Create a branch. Once we have forked the project, we need to create a branch to work on our changes. This will help us keep our changes separate from the main project.

- Make changes. Make the changes we want to make to the project. And we have to be sure to follow the project's coding style and test our changes.

- Commit changes. Once we have made our changes, we have to commit them. This will save our changes to our local repository and selected branch.

- Push the changes to the forked repository. This uploads the changes we made to our forked repository on GitHub.

- Create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch of the original repository. This notifies the original repository’s maintainers that we have made some changes and would like them to review and merge your contribution into their branch.
