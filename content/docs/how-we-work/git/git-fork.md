# Working with Forks

[Working with forks in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) allows us to create a copy of an existing repository and make changes to it without affecting the original project. We can use forks to experiment with new features, fix bugs, or contribute to open source projects. To work with forks, we need to clone the forked repository, add a remote for the original repository, create a branch for the changes, push the branch to GitHub, and propose changes with pull requests. We also need to [sync our fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with the upstream repository to keep it up-to-date.
