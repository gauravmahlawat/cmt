# Cron Jobs

Cron jobs are mostly used on web servers to carry out repetitive operations at a scheduled time. They can be used to automate a variety of tasks, such as periodically clearing out unnecessary files from an account, sending periodic emails like newsletters, flushing the website application's cache to make sure that it displays the most recent content, running routine maintenance checks, and reindexing and refreshing product and client information. For systems that operate continuously, like servers, cron jobs are recommended.

In order to operate on the web, cron jobs used the web server called a cron daemon. It launches your cron jobs at the appointed times by running in the background. All of your tasks and their times are listed in the configuration file crontab, which is where this schedule is kept. On a server, Cron is a background-running time-based job scheduler.
