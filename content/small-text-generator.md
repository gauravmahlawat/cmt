## Why Small Text Style?
The tiny text generator essentially converts your regular text into a series of small-caps and subscript characters. It appears small because it uses the so-called unicode alphabet. You can basically copy and paste the small text generator's output into Excel, Word, and other documents, as well as status updates on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Sadly, you wouldn't be able to accomplish that if the text were genuinely changed into a tiny font.

Example: 

## How to Create Tiny Text?

* The produced output will then appear in the right panel. 
* The text can then be easily copied.
* After that, paste it on your preferred social media site, such as Facebook or Twitter.
